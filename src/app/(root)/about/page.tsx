                <h1>Telman Mammadov</h1>
                <p>
                  Hi, Iâ€™m Telman Mammadov, a Front End Developer based in
                  Azerbaijan. I am extremely passionate and dedicated to my work
                  and learning further in my career field.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With 2+ years of experience as a developer, I have acquired
                  the skills necessary to build feature-rich and premium
                  websites.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I was first introduced to website a few years before I began
                  work as an intern website developer however, I was not aware
                  at the time that I would fall in love with frontend and
                  backend . I have primarily been using Typescript during my
                  years of web developer however I am always looking to expand
                  my knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lately I have been focusing heavily on web application UI
                  Design and UX Development. The tech stack is comprised of the
                  MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React and Node) paired with
                  TailwindCSS.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I aim to improve on a skill every day and I am studying
                  part-time to improve my capability and abilities in the
                  workplace. There are a vast amount of web design languages and
                  frameworks out there that I would like to learn including
                  React, Node.js to name a few.
